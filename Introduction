2. Introduction
2.1. Project Overview

The Propeller Display is a type of POV display where an array of LEDs mounted on a spinning propeller blade generates the illusion of a stable, readable image or text in mid-air. This is achieved by synchronizing the LED switching with the motor's rotation, leveraging the human eyeâ€™s inability to distinguish fast-moving light changes.

In our project, we utilize an Arduino Nano for its compact size and ease of programming. The system uses a 1000 RPM DC motor to rotate a lightweight PCB/wooden arm embedded with LEDs. Real-time code controls the LED blinking based on angular position estimation.

2.2. Applications

POV-based displays have a wide range of applications:

Consumer electronics: Clocks, advertising displays

Art installations: Interactive light-based art

Educational tools: Teaching embedded systems and electronics

Industrial indicators: Rotational displays for compact feedback systems

2.3. Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

Build a functioning propeller display using low-cost components.

Understand the integration of hardware (motor, LEDs, resistors) and software (Arduino code).

Demonstrate control and synchronization of hardware using embedded C/C++.
